Flattening a Linked List


struct node{

int data;

struct node *bottom_pointer;

struct node *nextpointer;

}


1)declare arr[n]  ==>n is the max size in problem given


2)using n^2 loop traverse all elements.

struct node *nextpointer =
while(nextpointer !=NULL)
{

         arr[i] = nextpointer->data;
         i++;
         

         bottom_pointer = head->bottom_pointer;

        while(bottom_pointer!= NULL)
		
		{


         arr[i] = bottompointer->data;
         i++;

         bottom_pointer = bottom_pointer->next;


        }

    head = head->nextpointer;
 

   nextpointer = head->nextpointer;


}



4)create new structure(for SLL) and insert all elements into single Linked List.
