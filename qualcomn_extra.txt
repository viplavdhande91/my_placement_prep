puzzle?
If we have three boxes each with two balls which can be either black or white are named wrong. 
Their name is such that it signifies the first letter of each ball’s color, which the box contained. 
For example a box containing a white and a black ball should have name: bb. But unfortunately all boxes are named wrongly. 
Find the minimum number of ball to be extracted to find out correct name of each box.
 Condition: each ball that is taken out should be replaced to the same box.
